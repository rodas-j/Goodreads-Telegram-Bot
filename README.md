# Telegram Goodreads Bot

## What it does

- Uses information from goodreads to provide details of any book you want. This includes name of the authors, rating, description and reviews.
- In the future I will add the functionality of reading reviews and also using this bot to request to enter the weekly reading challenge for Productivity Hub channel on Telegram (link it here)
